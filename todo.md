What We can do further in this app ?? 

There are few things We can do with this app.

For the FrontEnd Part...

1.  We can Use Some FrontEnd Libraries such as React, Vue.js, Next.js for better UI handling and rich customer experience with advanced features including api calling and all.

2. If Styling Matters then We can use Semantic UI, Bootstarp or Tailwind Css etc CSS styling framework for attractive GUI and Responsive GUI.

3. It is more about static web page we can add some functionality to add few button like 
    -  ADD TO ORDER
    -  ADD TO FAVOURITE
    -  ASK CHEF
4. Umm, will add Customization options for the items as well. 

BACKEND PART:

1. Security concern due to everything is available in the client side.
   Better Approach : Having a API or Microservice Based Architechture

2. Instead of maintaining Static Object of the Items in Menu we can use some NOSQL DB for this as it allows us to store data in diffrent collections so we can get rid of filtering it.
    i.e  we can store,delete,update,retrive pizza items from pizzaCollection in mongodb using better backend part. 
3. Grabbing Additional Detail
    If allowed, then I would also considering grabing few personal details for both business and better servig experience. 
     By getting 
        - email Id
        - name
        - how many persons are there
    I will make some data analysis for the better business strategy
    Also, ofc, our chef or waitier can customized order according to name of the person. 


That's all.
