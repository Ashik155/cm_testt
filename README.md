<h2> Answer to the Question 1 </h2>

Projects that I made so far.

    1. Pizza Ordering and Live Tracking Application 
        *   This app lets users order pizza and track the status of thier order in real time.
        *   Used Node JS, templating Engine, Express JS, Mongo DB for basic feature implemntation
        *   Real time programming was done using Socket.io which was triggered by some predefined event in bidirectional way.
        *   Authentication using email and password, and also used bcrypt for password storing mechanism
        *   Protected route mechanism using middleware so that unauthenticate user cannot access to few features that require user to logged in. 
        * github Link -> https://github.com/Ashik155/PizzaApp

    2.  Youtube Clone
        *   Built this clone that mimic the YouTube.
        *   Used React JS, Semantic UI, and REDUX for implementing this app.
        *   extenssive use of react for component reusability and redux for handling state in more effective way 
        *   Used Public API and Axios module in order to do most work with API. 
        *   Read.md file can explain you the core concepts of this app.
        *   GitHub Link -> https://github.com/Ashik155/Youtube_Using_api_react
        *   Live Demo : https://salty-brushlands-96867.herokuapp.com/

        *   Also used google OAuth and overrrided Django Authentication model for login and logout authentication mechanism.
        *   Customzed admin panel with custom style and used model serialization for the relation mapping with DB
        *   GitHub Link -> https://github.com/Ashik155/tubers-FollowedByCourse-
    
    4. Currently Project that I am working on extenssively 
        *   Serverless Auction App using AWS, Node.JS, and serverless Framework
        *   Tshirt store using lot of latest tech stacks such as MERN and etc.

Inspirations!

    1.  Netflix's architechture 
     Well, it is true that we all know Netflix is a famouse for the video streaming services and it is a fact that it is most successfull platform among others.
     So, that why I took a chance to know the IT infrastructure of Netflix and what I observed is that since few years back, it has decided to move whole service based archtechture to AWS and also implementing the distibuted computing concept using haddop and etc. In addition to that I can say it also lead me know to more about miroservices architechture, rich frontend designs and seamless fast backend services which they provided by numerous technology and I am learning more about it and working on one project currently that is Auction App which is inspired by this netflix. 

     2. Opening Tunnel of WEB 3.0 
     Umm, Okay, since I was feeling comfortable with client-server architecture, some genius found the eliminating middleman who is responsible for financial, ethical and lot more analogy, which relates to DATA, by using WEB 3.0 Concepts. It can be very useful if implemeneted properly due to it's security, Immutability of data, and other important features it offers which are being in tesing phase. i.e We will have alternative app of UBER which will connect you to direct taxi driver without inclusion of this giant service provider ( connector maybe ) so that both can find it easy and cheaper. What is for me in this. well, I have already purchased book and course by which I am trying to understanding NEW FUTURE of IT World with crypto and associated terms.

     3. Github Co-pilot 
     Enough of being honest with your coding exams. You have now github co-pilot which can now help you to complete your code automatically by finding most suitable lines of code that are closely matching with requirements. This is okay for the senior developers who is having lot of repetitive work load and now familiar with core concepts of software development because now all they need is pace that help firm moving in development further. But for a newbies it is still ethically not desiravle to use as it is hard to learn coding by using it. I am still studying it and have read some article which is saying that it used knowledge discovery for making autocompletion of code. But this is a good invention or not, debate is still going on. However, for me it is kind of a good thing as it is same as some top level software which makes lives bit easier and also reading more about  it how it works and all.


<h3> What I can build with CM in 6 months  </h3>

   Great question, that should be asked instead why do you want to work with us. So my answer is subjetive to be very fair. I am trying to be more practicle with my answer here. Well, I will first try to understand how my team is working and based on this, I will try to come at pace and level where I can feel more confident with my contrinution and role in development. I really think with specific role, I can be independent and work with team in more effective way after initial few weeks.

   Then, It is depend upon role that how much time should I ideally use and use resource in order to be ready to contribute. I will more focus on time, as  believe it is the only thing which matters. I will be utilizing my time with mostly learning and improving my self for the role that I have been assinged. Also, I will be keep in touch with the mentor and manager in view of not going to wrong direction. Once, I will be feeling more confident with what I have done in the learning phase, It is time to work for the goal of team. I think with proper time and resouce, in short period I CAN BE JOB READY.

   In summary I can say that within 6 month I can be a independent developer who can work more efficiently with team and help team to achieve the goal before deadline hit with proper resources,time and ofcourse great people.
